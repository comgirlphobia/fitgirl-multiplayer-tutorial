# Introduction
So, a LOT of people seem to have trouble getting this right. so I've decided, why not make a little tutorial for people? As it was quite confusing to figure this out myself lol.
Before we start, yes, you can scan the files in the repo (obviously), I will also provide links to the original source I got them from, just for the skeptical folk. If this tutorial doesn't work for you, I'm happy to help out, my discord is in my bio on my profile. I may also make a server if enough people interact with this. Anyways, lets get started on the tutorial.
# Requirements
Okay, so, first off, as any good tutorial should, lets start off with the requirements. You'll need, the fitgirl version of bo3, which if you for some reason do not have, it can be downloaded <a href="https://fitgirl-repacks.site/call-of-duty-black-ops-3/">here</a>
