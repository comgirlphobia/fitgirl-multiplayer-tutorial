# Introduction
So, a LOT of people seem to have trouble getting this right. so I've decided, why not make a little tutorial for people? As it was quite confusing to figure this out myself lol.
Before we start, yes, you can scan the files in the repo (obviously), I will also provide links to the original source I got them from, just for the skeptical folk. If this tutorial doesn't work for you, I'm happy to help out, my discord is in my bio on my profile. I may also make a server if enough people interact with this. Anyways, lets get started on the tutorial.
# Requirements
Okay, so, first off, as any good tutorial should, lets start off with the requirements. You'll need, the fitgirl version of bo3, which if you for some reason do not have, it can be downloaded <a href="https://fitgirl-repacks.site/call-of-duty-black-ops-3/">here</a>. You also need boiii client which I have provided in the repo, if you don't trust my exe, here is a <a href="https://github.com/Ezz-lol/boiii-free/releases/tag/v1.0.5">direct link</a> to it. The last 2 things you need are Steam, and the full game/update for bo3 (download it, and then start the tutorial), which I have also provided in this repo. 
# Tutorial
After you're done with the requirements, start by moving the boiii.exe into the "t7_full_game" folder. Then, go to the location of your fitgirl bo3, (which by default, is in C:\Games\Call of Duty - Black Ops 3), copy all of the files/folders listed below and put them in your "t7_full_game" folder. Any file/folder that is NOT listed, do NOT copy into the folder. 

  video folder
  zone folder
  unins000.dat (opt)
  unins000.exe (opt)
  SmartSteamEmu.ini
  SLF64.dll
  winmm.dll
  fake_steam.slf
  tier0_s64.dll
  vstdlib_s64.dll
  gameoverlayrenderer64.dll
  steamclient64.dll
  controller.vdf
  CrashUploader.exe
  d3dcompiler_46.dll
  installscript_311210.vdf
  localization.txt

Once done, make sure to launch the game through boiii.exe, and run it as an administrator. Once it's open, just press play, and wait for bo3 to open, it can take a bit sometimes.
